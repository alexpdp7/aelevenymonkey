# First panel

Gabe and Tycho are walking through a sea-side promenade.

Gabe: You called **Kara** about a game, and you didn't call me?

Tycho: It was a rhythm game. You have to know what is - and crucially, what is **not** - the beat.

# Second panel

Gabe is annoyed. Tycho is dancing. There's a busker playing a guitar.

Gabe: I don't even think "the beat" is real. Whatever Gloria Estefan might have said, I'm forty-four years old now - and the rhythm hasn't gotten me yet.

Gabe: I'm just saying. It woulda gotten me by now.

# Third panel

Gabe is disgusted. Tycho is holding Gabe's shoulders and smiling.

Tycho: I don't know why you've been cursed this way, to never feel it as God strums the universe. I am one of his strings.

Tycho: Rhythm games are just a bonus.
