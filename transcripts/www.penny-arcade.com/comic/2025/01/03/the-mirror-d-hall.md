# First panel

In the computer screen, Connor Hayes, VP of Product for Generative AI, Meta, is talking to the camera with the Facebook logo behind him.

Connor: "We expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do.

Connor: They'll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform... That's where we see all of this going."

# Second panel

Gabe is standing behind Tycho, who is sitting in front of a computer.

Tycho: Hang on, I don't speak corporate bullshit. Can you turn on the subtitles?

# Third panel

"We've lost the young, permanently - and we're terrified of the feral Gen Alpha. But our older users, the ones who are not yet dead, won't really understand what's happening.

Ultimately, investing advertising dollars in our platforms will be a hopeful but ultimately naive act, like flicking a coin into a wishing well."
