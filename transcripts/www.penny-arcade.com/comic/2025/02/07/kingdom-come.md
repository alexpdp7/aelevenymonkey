# First panel

Gabe and Tycho are walking through a snowed forest. Gabe looks worried.

Gabe: Some people are mad that Kingdom Come 2: Deliverance has the **gay** sex in there.

Tycho speaks confidently.

Tycho: Yeah, I think "some people" doth protest too much.

# Second panel

Gabe: Do they think it's gonna happen on accident?

Tycho: They live their entire lives this way, in constant fear. They're always just a couple dialogue options away from a homoerotic tryst.

# Third panel

Tycho: They're worried they're gonna order the wrong thing at Denny's and end up getting the "Sausage Slam."

Gabe smirks.

Gabe: It happens more than you think.
