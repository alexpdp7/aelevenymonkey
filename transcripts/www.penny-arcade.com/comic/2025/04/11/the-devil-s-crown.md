# First panel

An old man is sitting.
Gabe is standing in the doorway of a traditional Japanese-style house, dressed in samurai clothes.

Old man: Are you here to kill me, Samurai?

Gabe: Maybe! I don't know. I skipped all the dialogue and every cutscene.

# Second panel

Gabe points to an icon over the old man's head.

Gabe: I just came here because there's a little thing over your head.

# Third panel

Gabe looks suspicious and angry.
He is holding a sword blade close to the scared face of the old man.

Gabe: Should I kill you? Are you, like, a dick or something?

Old man: No!

Gabe: I dunno. I should probably do it just to be safe.
