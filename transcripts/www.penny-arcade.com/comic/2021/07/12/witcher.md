# First panel

A hot dog street vendor approaches Gabe and Tycho. Gabe is using his phone to search something augmented-reality style.

Hot dog vendor: You guys playing Pokemon Go? A kid just caught a squirtle around here.

Tycho: Absolutely not. We have mature tastes. That's why we play The Witcher: Monster Slayer for **men.**

# Second panel

The view opens and we see the hot dog stand. Gabe is pointing at something he sees in his phone.

Gabe: Uh oh. We're doing you a favor, dude. You've got a Drowner here.

Hot dog vendor: Is that **like** a Squirtle...?

Gabe: No!

# Third panel

Close up on Gabe and Tycho talking in an apologetical manner.

Gabe: Well, yeah. Kinda. A little.

Tycho: There are **some** overlaps.
