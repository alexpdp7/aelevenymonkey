# First panel

Gabe is lying on a couch. Tycho is using a computer in the background.

Tycho: What are we thinking about for a strip?

Gabe: Mortal Kombat II is about to hit, and it's got the blood on the Genesis version, so...

Tycho: What?

# Second panel

Gabe: Oh! And I just read a preview of the 32X. It's an impressive piece of hardware. I think it's gonna give the Genesis a new lease on life.

Tycho turns around to face Gabe and looks surprised.

Tycho: What?

# Third panel

Gabe: I forgot to mention: I don't read game news sites anymore. I **only** read issues of Sega Vision on the Internet Archive.

Tycho looks sad.

Tycho: Well, it was a good run.
