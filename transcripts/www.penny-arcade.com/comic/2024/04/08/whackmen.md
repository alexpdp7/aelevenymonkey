# First panel

Gabe is speaking confidently with his eyes closed, while Tycho looks at him in the background with an inquisitive look.

Gabe: This is what I came to understand.

Gabe: All I was doing on Twitter was blocking people. Even people I **liked!** It was Whack-a-Mole on an industrialized scale.

# Second panel

Gabe is turning his head to talk to Tycho, with a disdained look.

Gabe: In a moment of supreme clarity, I realized I could whack them all at once. Every mole. All of them. With one click.

Gabe: Forever.

# Third panel

The back of Tycho is partially visible, while Gabe looks confident.

Tycho: Dear God. You're going to delete your Twitter?

Gabe: I did it thirty-five minutes ago.

Transcription note: The layout of the strips mimicks like the dialogue one of the final scenes of the Watchmen comic, where Ozymandias reveals he executed his plan thirty-five minutes ago.
