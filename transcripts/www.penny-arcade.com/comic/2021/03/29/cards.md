# First panel

Gabe: What do you think about this Microsoft buying Discord stuff?

Tycho: I think that in five years, there will be exactly four companies and they will buy startups in booster packs like **Magic Colon The Fucking Gathering**.

# Second panel

Two old men in suits are opening card booster packs in a park. They are likely Gabe and Tycho.

Gabe: I've opened like ten packs and all trash. Intersia, Telosaur, Cyaphim.... a bunch of ecommerce integration shit. It's like, I already own that. What'd you get?

Tycho: I dunno. Let's see.

# Third panel

* Monthly MMR revenue: a dial graph with 102.5% in the center, a blue zone marked as 97% and a green zone marked as 103%.

The card is labelled as 38/102 in a series.
