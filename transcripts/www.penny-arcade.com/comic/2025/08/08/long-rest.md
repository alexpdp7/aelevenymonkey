# First panel

Gabe and Tycho are playing a card game. Tycho is touching a card.

Tycho: Alright. I'm gonna tap these.

Gabe: No, you aren't tapping shit. In the Gundam Card Game, we **rest** cards. Cards are **rested**.

# Second panel

Tycho: That's a beautiful fantasy. I'd love to be part of that world. But you know, and I know, that I tapped these cards.

Gabe: You didn't though, actually. Because you **can't**.

# Third panel

Tycho: What. Are the WOTC lawyers in the room right now?!

Gabe looks scared. There's a man with a suitcase below the table.

Gabe: You're making a joke, but yes.
