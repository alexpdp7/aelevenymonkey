# First panel

Gabe and Tycho are out in the snow. They are making a snowman.

Gabe: Are they really gonna start with Helldivers 2 for the movie? Why not start with "Helldivers"?

Tycho: Sony already made a Helldivers movie, and it's called **Starship Troopers.**

# Second panel

Tycho: They're making a movie based on a game that is just fan-fiction of their other movie.

Tycho: This is the midnight era we've entered. We're eating out of the compost bin.

# Third panel

Gabe: That doesn't sound great.

Tycho: But it **does** sound like Sony.
