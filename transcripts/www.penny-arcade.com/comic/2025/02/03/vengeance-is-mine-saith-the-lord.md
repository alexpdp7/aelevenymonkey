# First panel

Sam Altman is talking to Gabe and Tycho, who have a smug look.

Sam: I'm in a bad way, guys. Remember when I stole everything? Like, everything human beings have ever accomplished? Without compensation or remorse?

# Second panel

Sam cries.

Sam: Well... Well... Now somebody stole all the stuff **I** stole and they gave it away for free!

# Third panel

Close up of Gabe licking the tears off Sam's face.
