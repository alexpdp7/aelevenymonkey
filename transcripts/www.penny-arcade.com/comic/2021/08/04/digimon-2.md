# First panel

Gabe and Tycho are talking in a park bench.

Gabe: Nobody at home will play Digimon with me, but I set up a started deck anyway. I got my Breeding Area ready, and my Security Stack...

Tycho: Are those Digimon things?

Gabe: Yeah.

# Second panel

Gabe is sitting alone in a table playing cards. His speech bubble from the first panel continues.

Gabe: And then I drew my hand, and thought about what I wouldplay, but there was nobody on the other side of the table.

# Third panel

Back to the park bench.

Tycho: That's... really, **really** sad.

Gabe: I mean it's not like I set up both decks, and played against myself.

Tycho: That would be way better.
