# First panel

Gabe is in a low-light room, there's a flower vase on the table. He is looking nervously to one side.

Gabe: I dunno, Luca. I feel like you roped me into your weird GT7 car sex dungeon under false pretenses.

Gabe: I thought I was gonna be doing more, like... racing.

# Second panel

Besides the flower vase, there are salt and pepper shakers. Luca, an older man with a graying beard is talking to him.

Luca: Oh, but my friend. Your **heart** will race as I relate to you every detail of the **French Hot Hatch.**

Gabe is scared looking at a chain tied to his wrist and the table.

Gabe: Wait a second... when did you put this on me?

# Third panel

Luca is smiling.

Luca: Do not worry yourself about that. The steel cuff is only so you cannot escape. Ever.

Gabe is looking ironically at Luca.

Gabe: See, Luca, that's what makes me worry.
