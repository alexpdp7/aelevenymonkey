# First panel

Gabe and Tycho are sitting in a couch. Gabe is holding a game controller. Both have a worried look.

Gabe: I grabbed Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and it **really** takes me back.

## Second panel

Close up of Tycho speaking confidently.

Tycho: Absolutely. Back when blood and gore were the coins of the realm.

Tycho: Ninja Gaiden is a blood-soaked extravaganza seated on a throne of discarded limbs.

## Third panel

Back to both of them, they have their heads twisted sideways and they look sad.

Gabe: No, no.

Gabe: Back to when game cameras **sucked ass**.
